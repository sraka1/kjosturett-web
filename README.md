# Voliprav.si / Vote Correctly - A one-stop for Parliament elections in Slovenia

_Citizens have the right to non-biased information to cast an informed vote. We, the people of Slovenia, inspired by the people of Iceland, built this project to solve this problem for local elections._

### The process

Each party is given the same list of questions where they can fill out as pleased within a word count limit. This ensures that all parties are represented equally. Responses are then compiled and listed on our platform. Voliprav builds upon the legacy of a similar site in Iceland (Kjosturett) and holds integrity and transparency above all.

## Technical information

The master branch is currently being worked on in time for the 2022 parliamentary elections.

### manual build

```bash
yarn install
yarn build-data
```

**Node v8 or higher is needed to run the data build step**
You can then start the server at port 3000

```bash
yarn start
```

### docker-compose

Automatically build and run the app on port 3000
#### TODO: Add redis to docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Information on our Datasets

We have some relations in the dataset that have to be linked together. These relations complicate the project a bit but give us the benefit of having all the repo data in an easily readable and flat format. All data lives in the data folder. To build the dataset run ./build.sh inside the /data folder. All the output goes to /data/build folder. **Some data needs to be built separately.** We state this where needed.

Are you having trouble building the data? Please open a GitHub issue.

## Data sources

We have various data sources. Described below are data sources that are available after the build step, but the raw data is also available in /build

### /data/build/{{category}}.json

```json
[
  {
    "letter": "A",

    "statement": "<p>Björt framtíð hefur þegar beitt sér fyrir setningu fjárfestingaáætlunar...</p>"
  },
  {}
]
```

### /data/build/candidates.json

~~First 6 people from every party in every region~~ Disabled due to time constraints.

```json

### /data/build/categories.json

```

### /data/build/replies-candidates.json

Not implemented, due to lack ot fime
```json
[
  {
    "n": "Alþýðufylkingin",
    "r": "112541123451234512345123451234"
  },
  {}
]
```

.n represents the name where .r represents the reply.

### /data/build/replies-parties.json

```json
[
  {
    "n": "Alþýðufylkingin",
    "r": "112541123451234512345123451234"
  },
  {}
]
```

.n represents the name where .r represents the reply.

### How does the reply string work?

When a person answers all the questions, we generate a numerical sequence. Each number represents one question. You can think of this zero to one scale as 0 being extremely against (se ne strinjam) and 1 being (se strinjam). 0.5 is a neutral response. This is the format of each number in the sequence.

- 1 stands for very much against, with the value of _0_
- 2 stands for somewhat against, with a value of _0.25_
- 3 stands for neutral, with a value of _0.5_
- 4 stands for somewhat agree, with a value of _0.75_
- 5 stands for very much agree, with value of _1_
- 6 stands for no response
